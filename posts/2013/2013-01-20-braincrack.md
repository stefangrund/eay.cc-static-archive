> I run out of ideas every day! Each day I live in mortal fear that I've used up the last idea that'll ever come to me. If you don't wanna run out of ideas the best thing to do is not to execute them. You can tell yourself that you don't have the time or resources to do 'em right. Then they stay around in your head like **brain crack**. No matter how bad things get, at least you have those good ideas that you'll get to later.

> Some people get addicted to that brain crack. And the longer they wait, the more they convince themselves of how perfectly that idea should be executed. And they imagine it on a beautiful platter with glitter and rose petals. And everyone's clapping for them. But the bummer is most ideas kinda suck when you do 'em. And no matter how much you plan you still have to do something for the first time. And you're almost guaranteed the first time you do something it'll blow. But somebody who does something bad three times still has three times the experience of that other person who's still dreaming of all the applause. When I get an idea, even a bad one, I try to get it out into the world as fast as possible, 'cause I certainly don't want to be addicted to brain crack.

**Update, 14.12.2016:** Vom 20. Januar 2013 bis zum 19. Januar 2016 war dieser Blogeintrag unter der URL `braincrack.de` erreichbar, daher diese Überschrift. Sie fiel dann dem großen Domainputz von Dezember 2016 zum Opfer. ;)
