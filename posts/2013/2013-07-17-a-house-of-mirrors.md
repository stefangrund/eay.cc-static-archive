> We think like the machine we have made in the image of ourselves; the machine thinks like us as we have come to think about ourselves in the image of the machine. A house of mirrors.

– **Willard McCarty** in [The Residue of Uniqueness](http://www.cceh.uni-koeln.de/files/McCarty_final_0.pdf) (S. 8) über die Co-Evolution von Mensch und Maschine.
