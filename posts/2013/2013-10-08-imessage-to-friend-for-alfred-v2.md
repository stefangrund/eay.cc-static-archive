When someone wrote me an email a few days ago asking about my [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) extension "iMessage to Friend" and if it will ever be available for Alfred v2, I was a little bit surprised. Then I realized that I totally forgot to release the updated workflow to the public. I mailed it to a bunch of people, who asked me about it on Twitter when v2 was released earlier this year and I use it on a daily basis myself, but because I've spent a lot of time studying and working on other projects (I'm talking about you, [Jeffrey Jacob](//eay.cc/2013/introducing-jeffrey-jacob/)) I missed to write about it here. Sorry about that.

The updated "iMessage to Friend" (1.2) works basically the same way as before, but the setup is a little bit different from the last version. You can [download it from the new project page](http://eay.cc/projects/alfred-workflow-imessage-to-friend/), where you'll also find the setup instructions. Finally.
