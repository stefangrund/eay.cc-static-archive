> "When you look at encrypted communications, if they are properly encrypted, there is no real way to tell that they are encrypted. You canÂ´t distinguish a properly encrypted communication, at least in the theoretical sense, from random noise," says Snowden. He suggests that over time all societies realize that encryption is a necessity. "So if you have an alien civilization trying to listen for other civilizations, or our civilization trying to listen for aliens, there's only one small period in the development of their society where all of their communications will be sent via the most primitive and most unprotected means."

Apropos Fermi-Paradoxon: [Der bekanntlich beste Artikel zum Thema ist der hier von Wait but why](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html), solltet ihr unter einem Stein leben und den noch nicht kennen.
