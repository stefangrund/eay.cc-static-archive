![The image shows a suburban neighborhood with houses and trees under a clear blue sky. Superimposed in the middle of the image is text that reads ”Directed by DAVID LYNCH“ in a green, retro-style font, reminiscent of opening or closing credits in a film.](https://eay.cc/uploads/2024/david-lynch-stickers.jpg)
