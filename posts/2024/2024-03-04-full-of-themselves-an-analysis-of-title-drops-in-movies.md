> A title drop is when a character in a movie says the title of the movie they're in. Here's a large-scale analysis of 73,921 movies from the last 80 years on how often, when and maybe even why that happens.

A [single-serving site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-serving_site) featuring this interesting analysis and dataset by [Dominik Baur](https://do.minik.us/) and [Alice Thudt](https://www.alicethudt.de/). (via [Waxy](https://waxy.org/2024/03/full-of-themselves/))
