> Slash pages are common pages you can add to your website, usually with a standard, root-level slug like `/now`, `/about`, or `/uses`. They tend to describe the individual behind the site and are distinguishing characteristics of the IndieWeb.

Nice overview by [Robb](https://rknight.me/) (see also [my post about EchoFeed](https://eay.cc/2024/echofeed-send-your-posts-all-over-the-web/), his latest project). I definitely need more slash pages over here!
