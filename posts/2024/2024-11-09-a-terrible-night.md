Jimmy Kimmel ab Minute 7:43 im obigem Video:

> It was a terrible night for women, for children, for hundreds of thousands of hard-working immigrants who make this country go, um…
> 
> For healthcare, for our climate, for science, for journalism, for justice, for free speech. It was a terrible night for poor people, for the middle class, for seniors who rely on social security, for our allies in Ukraine… For NATO. For the truth and democracy and decency and it was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him.
> 
> **And guess what? It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him, too – you just don't realize it yet.**
