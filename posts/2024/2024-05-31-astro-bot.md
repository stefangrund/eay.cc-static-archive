I don't care about any of [the announcements on Sony's recent State of Play](https://www.theverge.com/24168001/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-silent-hill), except the sequel to their fantastic & free jump'n'run »[Astro's Playroom](https://eay.cc/2021/astros-playroom/)«. Coming to PS5 on September 6th.
