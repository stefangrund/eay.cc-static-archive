Malcolm Coles collects websites that forbid people from linking to them:

> 10+ years ago I created an annual list of websites that FORBADE you from linking to them, DEMANDED you write to ask for permission or LIMITED links to only their home page. Royal Mail even promised to post me a paper licence.
> 
> Now a decade has passed, let's see who's still doing it â€¦ And yes I've linked to your websites to prove this. Uh oh.
