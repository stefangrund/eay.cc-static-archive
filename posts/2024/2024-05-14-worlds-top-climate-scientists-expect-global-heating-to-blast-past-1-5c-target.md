> Planet is headed for at least 2.5C of heating with disastrous results for humanity, poll of hundreds of scientists finds

80% of scientists expect global warming of more than 2.5 degrees. Half even expect more than 3 degrees. (via [Thomas](https://gigold.me/blog/wochenendliste-5))

Reminder: [2.7 degrees would be "another planet"](https://eay.cc/2021/klimaforscher-johan-rockstroem-erderhitzung-von-27-grad-waere-ein-anderer-planet/).
