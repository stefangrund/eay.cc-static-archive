> ⁂ is a typographical character, not an icon that needs to be inserted as an image. Unique-looking, but standardised. This means it’s very easy to copy-paste around! \[…\]

> ⁂ is called an [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(typography)). In astronomy, it refers to groups of stars in the sky, akin to constellations. We suggest that it’s a very fitting symbol for the fediverse, a galaxy of interconnected spaces which is decentralised and has an astronomically-themed name. It represents several stars coming together, connecting but each their own, without a centre.

Nice idea. I just followed [@liaizon](https://social.wake.st/@liaizon/113033797692843486)'s example and set the iOS/macOS text replacement feature to expand \*\*\* into ⁂.
