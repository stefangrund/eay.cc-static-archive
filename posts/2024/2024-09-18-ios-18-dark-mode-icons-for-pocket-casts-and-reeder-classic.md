Last year when I switched to [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) for all my (cross-platform) podcast needs, [I released a purple version of the official app icon](https://eay.cc/2023/purple-app-icon-for-pocket-casts/), because, well, thanks to Apple Podcasts my brain is hardwired to think of podcasts as purple.

![The image displays three app icons: two for “Pocket Casts” in purple and black themes, and one for “Podcasts” with a purple circular design.](https://eay.cc/uploads/2024/pocket-casts-dark-icon.png)

When iOS 18 came out on Monday with support for alternative dark app icons, I quickly realized that my purple Pocket Casts icon wasn't really working there. So I went back to the Apple Podcasts app, which now only shows a purple icon on a dark gradient for dark mode. And so I updated my icon with the same style – [here's my purple Pocket Casts icon for dark mode](https://eay.cc/uploads/2024/pocket-casts-dark-purple-app-icon.png).

![The image shows two app icons for “Reeder”, both featuring a star on a dark, striped background, but with slightly different shades.](https://eay.cc/uploads/2024/reeder-dark-icon.png)

And while I was creating the icon, I noticed that the alternative "Reeder 4" icon, that I have always used as the icon for Reeder 5 (now "Reeder Classic"), didn't quite match the dark mode either. So I just changed it, [here is the slightly darker Reeder 4 icon](https://eay.cc/uploads/2024/reeder-classic-4-dark.png).
