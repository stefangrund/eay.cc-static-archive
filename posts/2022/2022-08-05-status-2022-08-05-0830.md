Version 1.0.9 of [Yonks](https://yonks.app/) is now available for iOS. It fixes a bug with the calendar export and optimizes some inner workings for iOS 16.

Also, â€“ and this is available on Android as well â€“ I've updated the suggestions and added the best countdown ever: the estimated due date of our daughter. ðŸ¥°
