A lot of my affection for Twitter comes from it‘s early & rich ecosystem of great third-party apps: [Twitterrific](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/twitterrific-tweet-your-way/id580311103) was the first one, Echofon my first app love, Tweetie had a superb design and even invented pull-to-refresh, YoruFukurou had an outstanding desktop keyboard navigation, while Birdhouse saved our tweet drafts. [Tweetbot](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id1527500834) brought Twitter clients to perfection.

I love that there’s resemblance of that with Mastodon. [The official one](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastodon/id1571998974) is good, but [Toot](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/toot/id1229021451), [Tootle](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/tootle-for-mastodon/id1236013466), [Mast](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129), [Mastoot](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastoot/id1501485410) (yes, these are their real names) and [Metatext](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/metatext/id1523996615) are even better. And new, promising apps like [Mammoth](https://testflight.apple.com/join/66c1wW8y) are being developed right now. Exciting app times!
