Great news for Mastodon's [app ecosystem](https://eay.cc/2022/twitters-early-and-mastodons-current-app-ecosystem/): Tapbots, makers of the great alternative Twitter client Tweetbot, [announced the development of “Ivory”](https://tapbots.social/@ivory/109433914793802708), their Mastodon client for iOS and macOS (!).

**Update, 24.01.2023:** After [Twitter’s ban of third-party clients](https://eay.cc/2023/twitterrific-end-of-an-era/) and therefore the destruction of it‘s developers income, [Tapbots discontinued Tweetbot](https://eay.cc/2023/tweetbot-april-2011-january-2023/) a couple of days ago. Today they launched their successor Ivory in “early access” for 2 Euro/month or 18 Euro/year (which is a steal!). [Here’s the website](https://tapbots.com/ivory/), [here’s the App Store link](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274).
