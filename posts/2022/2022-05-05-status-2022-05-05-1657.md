Just got the brand new Â»[The iOS App Icon Book](https://www.appiconbook.com/)Â« by [Michael Flarup](https://flarup.co/), a great overview/history of outstanding app icon design.

And then on page 119â€¦ is my work for [Yonks](https://yonks.app/). ðŸ˜³ðŸŽ‰ I feel really honored to see my work next to all my favorite app icons of the past 15 years.
