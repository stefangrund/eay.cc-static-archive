Twitter has 330 million monthly active users and 166 million daily active users.

Elon Musk had 117 million followers, when he [started a poll to ask if Donald Trump's account should be reinstated](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593767953706921985). He claimed that 134 million people saw this poll.

But only 15 million users voted in the poll, which they didn't know was coming. That's only 4,5% of all Twitter users, only 12,8% of Musks followers and only 11,2% of all people who saw this.

“The people have spoken.”
