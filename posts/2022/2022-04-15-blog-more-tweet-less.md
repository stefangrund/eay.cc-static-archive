> If you’re working on your own new blog or have an existing one it’s good to write smaller posts like this one, not share on Twitter all of the time. I find that I get more engagement, grow my traffic and more importantly own my content when I simply treat my blog as I want – to share my thoughts, big or small.

> Why don’t you give it a go for 30 days? Hide your Twitter app from your main home screen and add your blogging platform one instead.

Guter Tipp von [LJPUK](https://ljpuk.net/), vor allem vor dem Hintergrund von Elon Musks angedrohter feindlicher Twitter-Übernahme.
