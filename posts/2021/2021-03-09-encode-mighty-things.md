![ECHO ALPHA YANKEE ZULU](https://eay.cc/uploads/2021/encode-mighty-things.png)

> [NASA JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) engineers [landed a rover on Mars](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance-rover). People from around the world [decoded the message in the parachute](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297094/hidden-message-parachute-nasa-mars-perseverance-rover) they designed.
> 
> I just made this small tribute to their work. You can see other things Iâ€™ve done at [my personal homepage](http://noahliebman.net) (because those are still a thing).
