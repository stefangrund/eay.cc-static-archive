> In iOS 14.5, there's a new option to unlock an â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ with Face ID and an Apple Watch paired together, with the Apple Watch's authentication providing an extra layer of security.
> 
> If you're wearing an unlocked Apple Watch and use Face ID as you normally would, the â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ will unlock after a partial face scan. When the unlock happens, you'll feel a haptic buzz and will receive a notification on the Apple Watch informing you that the unlocking procedure was successful, similar to how it works when unlocking a Mac with an Apple Watch.

Die Beta ist gestern erschienen. Der finale Release wird dann vermutlich auch im Februar erfolgen. ðŸŽ‰
