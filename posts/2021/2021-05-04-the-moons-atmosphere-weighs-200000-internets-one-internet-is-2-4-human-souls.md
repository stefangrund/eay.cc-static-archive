> 1\. The entire internet, i.e. all the electrons in all the electricity: [about 50 grams, the same as a plump strawberry](https://futurism.com/the-world-contained-in-a-strawberry-2). \[...\]

> 2\. The entire atmosphere of the Moon: [less than 10 metric tonnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_the_Moon). c.f. Earth’s atmosphere which is about [5.15 million gigatons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth). \[...\]

> 3\. The total volume of Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) in the whole world: [about 160 milliliters](https://theconversation.com/all-the-coronavirus-in-the-world-could-fit-inside-a-coke-can-with-plenty-of-room-to-spare-154226), roughly 6 shot glasses.

> 4\. The human soul: \[...\] \[In 1901 Duncan MacDougall\] measured the patients’ loss of mass at the very moment of death, when the soul departs the body. The result and therefore the weight of the soul: [21 grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_grams_experiment). \[...\]

Great observations and comparisons by [Matt Webb](https://interconnected.org/home/), whose blog I can't recommend highly enough.
