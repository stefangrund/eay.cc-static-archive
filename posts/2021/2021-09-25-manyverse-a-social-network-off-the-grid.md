> Manyverse is a social networking app with features you would expect: posts, likes, profiles, private messages, etc. But it's not running in the cloud owned by a company, instead, your friends' posts and all your social **data live entirely in your phone**. This way, even when you're offline, you can scroll, read anything, and even write posts and like content! When your phone is back online, it **syncs the latest updates directly** with your friends' phones, through a shared local Wi-Fi or on the internet.

Nicht getestet, aber super spannender Ansatz. (via [THEFUTURE #76](https://steadyhq.com/de/thefuture/posts/7ca2042f-9f0c-4b5b-bc73-255d4ce6fe0d))
