ðŸ“· Photoblogging Challenge, Day 23: Oh **Banana** Joe, [@ohBananaJoe](https://micro.blog/ohBananaJoe)!

Because of today's prompt I got the idea to replay Â»[Slaps & Beans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Spencer_%26_Terence_Hill:_Slaps_and_Beans)Â«. Despite the mediocre gameplay, it's a really nice nostalgia trip, if you're into Bud Spencer & Terence Hill movies. Especially in co-op.
