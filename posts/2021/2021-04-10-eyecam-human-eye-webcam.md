> Sensing devices are everywhere, up to the point where we become unaware of their presence. Eyecam is a critical design prototype exploring the potential futures of sensing devices. Eyecam is a webcam shaped like a human eye. It can see, blink, look around and observe you.

> Eyecam is a research project by [Marc Teyssier](https://marcteyssier.com). With contribution of [Marion Koelle](https://www.marionkoelle.de/), [Paul Strohmeier](http://embodimentlabs.org/blog2/), [Bruno Fruchard](https://www.brunofruchard.com/) and [Jürgen Steimle](https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/people/juergen-steimle/). This research was conducted during my stay at Saarland University [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/).
