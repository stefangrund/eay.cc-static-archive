> My blog´s older than Twitter and Facebook, and it will outlive them. It has seen Flickr explode and then fade. It´s seen Google Wave and Google Reader come and go, and it´ll still be here as Google Plus fades. When Medium and Tumblr are gone, my blog will be here.

> The things that will last on the internet are not owned. Plain old websites, blogs, RSS, irc, email.
