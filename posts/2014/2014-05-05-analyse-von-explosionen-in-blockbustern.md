> Think of summer action blockbusters, and noisy explosions come to mind. But are all explosions the same? To find out, I analyzed the explosions (1,094 in all) of nine top-grossing blockbusters spanning four decades, and it turns out there are two distinct types of popcorn movie pyrotechnics: "dramatic explosions", which have a significant narrative or emotional impact (think of the Death Star bursting at the end of the original "Star Wars"), and "decorative destruction", in which explosions are deployed in a barrage, like fireball wallpaper.

Kann daraus bitte jemand eine eigene Seite mit viel mehr Filmen machen?
