> Charleston wedding photographer Raheel Gauba was shooting engagement photos of a young couple posing on the steps of a Meeting Street building last month when someone grabbed his subjects' attention. \[...\] "I turn around and it's Bill Murray with his shirt up, belly out, tapping his belly and trying to make them laugh."
