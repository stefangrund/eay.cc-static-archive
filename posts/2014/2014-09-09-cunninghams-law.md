> Cunningham's Law states "the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer."
> 
> The concept is named after [Ward Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham), father of the wiki. According to [Steven McGeady](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_McGeady), the law's author, Wikipedia may be the most well-known demonstration of this law.
