![A dark-themed screenshot of the Gulf of Mexico region. The map includes parts of the southeastern United States, eastern Mexico, and islands in the Caribbean. Major city names (e.g., Houston, New Orleans, Havana) are visible in white text. The body of water is humorously labeled as 'Gulf of What-a-Shit-Show' instead of its proper name.](https://eay.cc/uploads/2025/gulf-of-what-a-shit-show.png)
