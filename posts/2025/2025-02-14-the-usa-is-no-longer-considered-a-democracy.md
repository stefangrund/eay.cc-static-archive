Full quote of [a short, horrifying Kottke post](https://kottke.org/25/02/0046213-on-a-scale-of-10):

> On a scale of +10 (full democracy) to -10 (full autocracy), [the US now scores a 0](https://www.systemicpeace.org/index.html), its lowest score [since the Civil War](https://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/P5UnitedStates2025.pdf). “The USA is no longer considered a democracy and lies at the cusp of autocracy.”

For comparison: No data for Germany, but France has been a 10 since 1986. And the U.S. scored an 8 in Biden's term and a 5 in Trump's first term.
