> Support for links is the basic requirement of the web, the same way we say feeds are required to be a podcast. If you don't support links not only aren't you the web, you're anti-web.
> 
> This is important because the "social" side of it is where that ignorance propagated. We started off with a network of writers, and ended up with business models of oligarchs. It's time to start building webs like we mean it and damn all the wannabe-billionaires. The web is not just a name, it's an idea, a basic value, a way of working with each other.

[Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/) hat auf [oursocialweb.org](https://oursocialweb.org/) ein kleines, sehr richtiges Manifest geschrieben.
