Giles Turnbull über eine der größten Stärken des Bloggens:

> Over time, a blog becomes a corpus of knowledge - your knowledge, or your organisation’s knowledge. A blog is your brain, over time, on the internet. An archive of what you think now and what you thought before. And that means it’s one of the simplest and most effective ways you can make things open, and make things better.
