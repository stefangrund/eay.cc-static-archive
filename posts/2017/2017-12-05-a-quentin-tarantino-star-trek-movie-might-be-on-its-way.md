> A new report indicates Tarantino pitched a concept for a new Trek film to Star Trek producer J.J. Abrams, and that Abrams is planning to assemble a writerâ€™s room to make Tarantinoâ€™s idea a reality. If it works out, Tarantino might direct the next Star Trek film himself. Again, weâ€™re not making this up.
