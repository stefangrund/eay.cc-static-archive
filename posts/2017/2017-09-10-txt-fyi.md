[Rob Beschizza](http://beschizza.com/) made "the dumbest publishing platform on the web". It’s featurelessness is it’s feature:

> There’s no tracking, ad-tech, webfonts, analytics, javascript, cookies, databases, user accounts, comments, friending, likes, follower counts or other quantifiers of social capital. The only practical way for anyone to find out about a posting is if the author links to it elsewhere.
> 
> Long live the independent web!
