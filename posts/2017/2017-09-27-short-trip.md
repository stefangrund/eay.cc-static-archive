> Short Trip is the first instalment in a collection of interactive illustrations created for the web. It has been created as a study into capturing the essence of graphite on paper within a digital context, and to learn more about web-based graphics technologies. Short Trip will run on most devices supporting WebGL, including mobile devices.

Sehr tolle und beeindruckende Arbeit von [Alexander Perrin](http://alexanderperrin.com.au/). (via [Waxy](https://waxy.org/))
