Interesting development in the WordPress community: After creating it's modern, React-based [Calypso interface](https://eay.cc/2015/calypso-ein-neues-backend-fuer-wordpress-2/) in 2015, Automattic and the WordPress team are now parting ways with React, because of a patent issue in it's license. They are going to rewrite their upcoming [Gutenberg editor](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) with a new, yet to be chosen JavaScript framework, which then should become the new standard for WordPress.

While [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact), a lightweight React alternative with the same API, would be the obvious replacement, a majority of the community prefers a switch to [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). An opinion I highly support. I had the opportunity to learn and work with Vue.js in my day job and for [shortfil.ms](https://shortfil.ms/) 2.0 in the last couple of months and I'm hooked. I think it's right up WordPress' alley, because it's an easy to learn, yet powerful framework and could be a perfectly fitting foundation for modern front-end development with WordPress in the years to come.

**TL;DR:** +1 for Vue.js
