[Tweetbot 5](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/tweetbot-5-for-twitter/id1018355599?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lohW) is such a nice app. A shame it's based on and build for a platform, whose management doesn't value and encourage a rich ecosystem of third party clients and instead pushes a "one size fits all" approach for millions (!) of users, just because they don't understand their own product (which could have been the centralized real time layer of the web) and how to monetize it.

In the long-term their missing understanding will turn out to be a good thing, because it forced us relatively early to create truly open and independent microblogging alternatives, which will replace their privately owned predecessor sooner rather than later.
