Really enjoyed the latest issue of [Kottke](https://kottke.org/)'s [“Noticing” newsletter](https://kottke.org/newsletter/). A great collection of reader recommended blogs and newsletters, ending with a great quote by [Kari](https://karigee.com/), about why she keeps on blogging:

> I also keep it out of spite, because I refuse to let social media take everything. Those shapeless, formless platforms haven't earned it and don't deserve it. I've blogged about this many times, but I still believe it: When I log into Facebook, I see Facebook. When I visit your blog, I see you.
