Microblogging funfact: As [@mrmnkys](https://twitter.com/mrmnkys) recently discovered (thx!) the first post in the screenshot on [App.net's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App.net) is by yours truly. It's my old cartoon avatar, which is still in use here on my blog and was made by [Nasendackel](https://www.nasendackel.de/) back in 2012.
