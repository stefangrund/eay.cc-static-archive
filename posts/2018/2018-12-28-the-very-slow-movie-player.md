> VSMP is an object that contains a Raspberry Pi computer, custom software, and a reflective ePaper display (similar to a Kindle), all housed inside a 3D printed case. Every 2.5 minutes a frame from the film stored on the computer’s memory card is extracted, converted to black and white using a dithering algorithm, and then communicated to the reflective ePaper display. This adds up to playing the film at a rate of 24 frames per _hour_, which is in contrast to the traditional speed of 24 frames per second. That’s the slow part, obviously.

Großartiges Projekt von [Dash Marshall](http://dashmarshall.com/), das ich mir auch sofort in Wohn-, Schlaf- und Arbeitszimmer stellen würde. (via [Kottke](https://kottke.org/18/12/the-very-slow-movie-player))
