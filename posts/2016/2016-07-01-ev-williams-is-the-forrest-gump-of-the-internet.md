Portrait über Ev Williams, den Gründer von Blogger, Odeo/Twitter und Medium, über das Open Web, Kreativität und wie er mit Textboxen ((Nice one, Mr. Meyer! 👌🏻)) die Welt verändert hat und reich geworden ist.

> His startups have nearly all specialized in the same abstract medium: text boxes. He has dotted the web with these text boxes, and people have poured their souls into them, have argued and wept and whispered into them. Millions of people have had their worldview shaped by these text boxes, and the boxes themselves have, in turn, changed the Internet. They have also made Williams rich. Though few of his businesses have turned a profit, he is a billionaire.
