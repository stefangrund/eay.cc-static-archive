> A classic “Bill Murray Story” is a tale, told in the first person, that starts out sounding believable enough – before suddenly taking a bizarre turn that involves actor Bill Murray doing something ridiculous. Typically these stories end with Bill saying “No one will ever believe you“, or something to that effect.
