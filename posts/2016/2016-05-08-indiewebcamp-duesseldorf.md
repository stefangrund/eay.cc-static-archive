Really enjoyed the last two days at the [IndieWebCamp in DÃ¼sseldorf](http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/Dusseldorf). Thanks to [Jeremy](https://adactio.com/), [Aaron](https://aaronparecki.com/) and [Tantek](http://tantek.com/) for hosting it. Thanks to the sponsors and especially [Sipgate](http://www.sipgate.de/) for providing a great venue and even better food. ðŸ˜‰

I learned a lot about interesting technologies, tried some of them on my own and had some great discussions, especially about the personal website vs. professional website thing some of us are experiencing and thinking about right know.

I'm looking forward to incorporate even more IndieWeb features and techniques into this site, encourage you to do the same and join a IndieWebCamp near you. ðŸ˜Œ
