I just learned about Packal, a great service by [Shawn Patrick Rice](http://shawnrice.org/) and _the missing link_ in the _Alfredverse_.

Also I just updated to [Alfred 3](https://alfredapp.com/), which now features a multimedia clipboard, auto-expansion of snippets and more flexible workflows. I highly recommend to update and support [Andrew](https://twitter.com/preppeller)'s and [Vero](https://twitter.com/vero)'s work and their incredibly useful piece of software.
