> The remix method of copying, transforming and combining is definitely used in The Force Awakens, as well as the other works of JJ Abrams. Is remixing a weak point in The Force Awakens? Is the remix method growing stale? Have we reached the limits of remixing?

Schöne Fortsetzung von [Kirby Ferguson](http://www.kirbyferguson.com/)s »[Everything is a Remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/)«-Serie, die er jetzt [per Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kirby/everything-is-a-remix-star-wars-edition) fortführen möchte.
