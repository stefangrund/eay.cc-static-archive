> “It’s time for global leaders to start telling the truth,” said \[Andrew\] Weaver, a professor at the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria in Canada. “We will not limit warming to 1.5C; we will not limit warming to 2.0C. It’s all hands on deck now to prevent 3.0C global warming - a level of warming that will wreak havoc worldwide.”
