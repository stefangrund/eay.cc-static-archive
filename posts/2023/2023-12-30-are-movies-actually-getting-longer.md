I'm all too familiar with the feeling that movies are getting longer and longer. Especially now with a toddler, we prefer shorter movies, but they're not even that easy to find these days.

To get to the bottom of this anecdotal evidence, [Matt](https://birchtree.me/) has pulled the top 50 of each decade – from the 1970s to 2020s – from Letterbox and analyzed the playing time of the films.

The result: Yes, they are getting longer. Not by much on average, but overall there are significantly more films over two hours long nowadays.
