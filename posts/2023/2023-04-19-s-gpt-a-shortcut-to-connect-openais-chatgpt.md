While I love [Raycast‚Äôs ChatGPT integration](https://www.raycast.com/ai) on my Mac, I have to say that S-GPT, [@viticci](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci)‚Äòs Shortcut for ChatGPT is by far the best integration of OpenAI‚Äòs LLM chatbot for iOS and iPadOS.

Try it, super easy setup. All you need is a (paid) API key from OpenAI, [which you can get here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Great work, Federico! üôèüèª
