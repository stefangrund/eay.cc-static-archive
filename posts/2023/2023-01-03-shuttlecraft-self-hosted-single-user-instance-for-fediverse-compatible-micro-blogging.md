> It's a small, "easy to host" web app that contains almost everything you need to host your own personal "instance" of a federated ActivityPub server. Your shuttlecraft hosts your social media identity, along with the tools to post, follow, and interact with other people on any other compatible service like Mastodon, GoToSocial, and others.

[Ben Brown](https://benbrown.com/) is building a single-user "instance", which is relatively easy to host with Node.js.

That's exactly the kind of software the Fediverse is missing, [I think and said already](https://eay.cc/2022/status-2022-11-06-1303/): Make it as easy as WordPress to install a single-user Fediverse agent and (tech-savvy) people who don't want to depend on an unknown Mastodon instance admin will start doing it.
