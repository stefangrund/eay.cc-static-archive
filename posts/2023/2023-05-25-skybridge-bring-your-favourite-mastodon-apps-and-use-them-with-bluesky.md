> SkyBridge is a magical server that translates Mastodon requests into Bluesky ones, allowing you to unlock the power of incredible Mastodon apps like Ivory and use them on the Bluesky network.

Made by [videah](https://meow.social/@videah). It's work in progress, but already work great and allows you to post to Bluesky via [Tapbots](https://tapbots.com/)â€™ excellent Mastodon app Ivory, for example. ðŸ¤¯

Maybe Mastodon app developers should incorporate something like this right into their apps to become universal, protocol agnostic microblogging clients.
