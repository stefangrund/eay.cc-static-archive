![Three podcast app icons](https://eay.cc/uploads/2023/pocket-casts-in-purple.png)

A few months ago I switched to [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) for all my (cross-platform) podcast needs. I couldn't be happier with the app, but there's one thing: Podcasts have to be purple ((Thank you, Apple.)) and so does my podcast client's app icon. And while there's a great variety of app icon designs within Pocket Casts already ((For example, I really like the colorful one for the current Pride month.)), there's no Apple-Podcasts-like, purple one.

Until now! [Here's my purple app icon for Pocket Casts.](https://eay.cc/uploads/2023/pocket-casts-purple-app-icon.png)

**Update, 18.09.2024:** I've just released [a dark purple version for iOS 18's dark mode](https://eay.cc/2024/ios-18-dark-mode-icons-for-pocket-casts-and-reeder-classic/).
