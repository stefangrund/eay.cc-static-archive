Jason Kottke has reactivated comments at his site - but for paying [members](https://kottke.org/members/) only.

> So why comments? And why now? Blog comments have been long since left for dead, a victim of spam, social media, toxicity, and neglect. But there are still plenty of sites out there with thriving communities.

> The timing feels right. Twitter has imploded and social sites/services like Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon are jockeying to replace it (for various definitions of "replace").

Great move & timing. Bring back the Good Ol' Web!
