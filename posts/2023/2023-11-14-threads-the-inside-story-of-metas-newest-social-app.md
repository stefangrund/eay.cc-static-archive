From Meta's engineering blog. At least they continue to talk explicitly about ActivityPub and the Fediverse. However, no mention of the EU launch.

> Our goal with Threads is to make social content as interoperable as email. We are working on the ability for Threads to integrate with [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/), the open, decentralized social networking protocol.

> My ultimate hope for Threads is that it becomes the zeitgeist of the internet.
