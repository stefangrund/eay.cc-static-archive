In the [recent episode](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) of the [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com/) podcast [Andrew](https://canion.omg.lol/), [Martin](https://loungeruminator.net/) & [Jason](https://grepjason.sh/) talk about their default apps in several categories. This has prompted some bloggers to share their default apps as well, which [Robb](https://rknight.me/) is now [collecting over here](https://defaults.rknight.me/).

I really enjoyed hearing about their app usage and reading these posts as well, so I thought I'll share my default apps, too: ((The last time I did this for my macOS apps [was in 2014](https://eay.cc/2014/meine-mac-essentials/) â€“ back when it was still called Mac OS X. ðŸ˜³))
