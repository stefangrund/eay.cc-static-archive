The new, web-based Mastodon client Elk is really impressive.

Built on top of [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), it works great as a PWA and has a lot of nice little UI touches. Now my favorite client on desktop and great on mobile as well. ([Posted from Elk on my iPhone.](https://eay.social/@eay/109695069234301059))
