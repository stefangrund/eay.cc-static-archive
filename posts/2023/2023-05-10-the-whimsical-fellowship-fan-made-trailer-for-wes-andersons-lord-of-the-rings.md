> Embark on a fantastical journey to Middle-earth reimagined through the eccentric and charming lens of Wes Anderson in "The Whimsical Fellowship."

After [Wes Anderson's Star Wars](https://eay.cc/2023/the-galactic-menagerie-fan-made-trailer-for-wes-andersons-star-wars/), here's an AI generated version of his Tolkien adaptation. From the [same makers](https://m.youtube.com/@curiousrefuge) as the trailer last time. (via [@InspektorSKAdget](https://det.social/@InspektorSKAdget/110343480080014645))
