Ok, somehow I managed to get a copy of "Make Something Wonderful" by [The Steve Jobs Archive](https://eay.cc/2022/the-steve-jobs-archive/), which is currently going for $200-500 on eBay, [for 86 Euros](https://eay.social/@eay/110526554862880703). ðŸ¥³

If you didn't take a look already, [here's the wonderful digital version](https://book.stevejobsarchive.com/) of the book, which is not available in stores, but was only given to selected Apple and Pixar employees. And [here's a detailed look by Arun Venkatesan](https://arun.is/blog/make-something-wonderful/) at the physical and digital book.

Cool to have this at home now.
