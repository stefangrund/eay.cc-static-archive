> Here lies a nearly-complete archive of Whole Earth publications, a series of journals and magazines descended from the Whole Earth Catalog, published by [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand) and the [POINT Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Foundation_(environment)) between 1970 and 2002.

Article from [WIRED about this](https://www.wired.com/story/whole-earth-catalog-now-online-internet-archive/):

> The Whole Earth Catalog was the proto-blog—a collection of reviews, how-to guides, and primers on anarchic libertarianism printed onto densely packed pages. It carried the tagline “Access to Tools” and offered know-how, product reviews, cultural analysis, and gobs of snark, long before you could get all that on the internet.

> At the time of its initial publication in the late 1960s, the periodical became a beacon for techno-optimists and back-to-the-land hippies. \[…\] The catalog also had a profound impact on Silicon Valley’s ethos, and is credited with seeding the ideas that helped fuel today’s startup culture. Steve Jobs famously referenced the Whole Earth Catalog [in a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc?t=13m08s) \[at 13:08\], likening it to Google before Google existed.
