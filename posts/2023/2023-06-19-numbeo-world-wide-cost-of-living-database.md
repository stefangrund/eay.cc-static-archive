> Numbeo is the world’s largest cost of living database. Numbeo is also a crowd-sourced global database of quality of life data: housing indicators, perceived crime rates, healthcare quality, transport quality, and other statistics.

[Here, for example, Cologne](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Cologne), where rents are on average about 72% lower than in New York. (via [Jens](https://mastodon.social/@jHeydt))
