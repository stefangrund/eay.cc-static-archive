Interne E-Mail vom 15.01.2003, die das 2000er Microsoft in a nutshell aufzeigt:

> I decided to download Moviemake and buy the Digital Plus r pack \[sic!\] so I went to Microsoft.com. They have a download place so I went there. \[â€¦\] This site is so slow it is unusable.

> So after more than an hour of craziness and making my programs list garbage and being scared and seeing that Microsoft.com is a terrible website I haven't run Moviemaker and I haven't got the plus package.

> The lack of attention to usability represented by these experiences blows my mind.
