Speaking of [content subscriptions](https://eay.cc/2023/the-pioneer-abo/): I've also just subscribed to [Club MacStories](https://club.macstories.net/). Long-time fan of their extensive app and OS reviews, as well as their presented Shortcuts and tips. How fitting that [Federico](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci) and [John](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@johnvoorhees) shared useful Shortcuts for my favorite todo-app [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) in the first issue I've read.

My only criticism: I have the smallest subscription tier and am regularly confronted with the upselling of the higher, more expensive tiers. I understand why there are often multiple paid tiers, but I'm not a fan of it – especially in SaaS products – because it gives the impression that the smaller, paying customers are less valued. ((The project management tool [Asana](https://asana.com/), which [we](https://hypercode.de/) used ourselves until recently, is a good negative example of this: 10,99 Euro per user per month in "Premium", but if you now want to use a minimum of the more advanced "Business" features, it costs 24,99 Euro. Why not just one subscription with all features for 16,99 Euro, in which I don't get the feeling that I'm missing out something or aren't as valuable as the "Business" users?))
