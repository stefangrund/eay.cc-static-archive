> The Satellite Transit Finder is a web application designed to aid planning the observations of lunar and solar transits of the few largest artificial satellites of our planet: the International Space Station, Hubble Space Telescope and Tiangong (Chinese Space Station). It is designed to be intuitive and easy to understand even for non-astronomically inclined observers.

This can then be used to time [sightings like these](https://astrodon.social/@BeckePhysics/109643596172182946).
