> The Magic Highlighter is a brand new Safari Extension for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that automatically highlights search terms and phrases on search result web pages.

Good idea and actually surprising that browsers don't do this by themselves already. And also a good slogan:

> Friends don’t let friends use old-fashioned ⌘-F.
