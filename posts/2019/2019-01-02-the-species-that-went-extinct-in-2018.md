Der _Wilflife Ecologist_ [David Steen](https://davidasteen.com/) stellt in seinem Blog seit 2012 jährliche Listen mit ausgestorbenen Spezies zusammen – weil das sonst niemand macht:

> Since 2012 I have gathered in one place a list of all the animals that went extinct in the previous year. Click here for the [2017](https://www.livingalongsidewildlife.com/2017/12/the-animals-that-went-extinct-in-2017.html), [2016](http://www.livingalongsidewildlife.com/2016/12/the-animals-that-went-extinct-in-2016.html), [2015](http://www.livingalongsidewildlife.com/2015/12/what-animals-went-extinct-in-2015.html), [2014](http://www.livingalongsidewildlife.com/2014/12/22-animals-that-went-extinct-in-2014.html), [2013](http://www.livingalongsidewildlife.com/2013/12/10-animals-that-went-extinct-in-2013.html), and [2012](http://www.livingalongsidewildlife.com/2013/01/animals-that-went-extinct-in-2012.html) editions. I started this series because I didn't know of anybody else summarizing this kind of important information. Interestingly, now I keep getting e-mails from people that found one of my lists and want to know if I know of a website that compiles lists of species that have recently gone extinct. Yes there is; you are reading it.
