Die Monetarisierung von [Steve Jobs](//eay.cc/tag/steve-jobs/)' digitalen Überresten geht weiter mit einem 1994 geführten Interview der [Santa Clara Valley Historical Association](http://siliconvalleyhistorical.org/), die demnächst in Gänze käuflich zu erwerben sein wird. Hier zwei bemerkenswerte Ausschnitte daraus, in denen Jobs über das Leben und das Scheitern philosophiert:

> When you grow up you, tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That´s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you´ll never be the same again.

> Most people never pick up the phone, most people never ask. And that´s what separates, sometimes, the people that do things from the people that just dream about them. You gotta act. And you gotta be willing to failâ¦ if you´re afraid of failing, you won´t get very far.
