> When written in the international ISO 8601 format YYYYMMDD, 2020-02-02 is the first palindromic date since 2011-11-02. \[...\] Of course, this is also a symmetrical date when written in the American format MMDDYYYY, i.e. 02/02/2020. Moreover, that date is also palindromic in the long German date format DDMMYYYY, this is 02.02.2020.
